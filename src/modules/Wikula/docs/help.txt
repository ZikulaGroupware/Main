Upload the Wikula folder to your Zikula /modules folder.

In your Zikula administration panel, in the Modules Section
Regenerate your modules list, initialize the Wikula module
and follow the interactive installation.

Wikula uses the Q, THEAD, TBODY, and some others HTML Tags.
It's recommended to enable them ("without parameters" at least)
to display the contents properly.
Enable them in your Admin Panel > Settings > HTML Settings
