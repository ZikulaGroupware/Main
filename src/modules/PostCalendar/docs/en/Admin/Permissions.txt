## PostCalendar v7.0.0 Permissions settings

As of version 7 (and 6.2), PostCalendar supports <span class="underline">category-based</span> permissions and <span class="underline">event-based</span> permissions.

In order to deny access to unregistered users to a particular event, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | PostCalendar::Event | <event title>::<event id> | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | PostCalendar::Event | My Birthday::247 | No access`

In order to deny access to unregistered users to all events in a certain category, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | <Category ID>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | 93:: | No access`

In order to allow all registered users to submit event, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Users| PostCalendar:: | .* | Add access`

You can restrict this to less users by choosing a different group.

In order to allow a subgroup to administrate PostCalendar events, you can use a permission setting like so:

`CalendarAdmins | PostCalendar:: | .* | Delete access`

Be sure to define the group and assign members as appropriate.

*Remember that the <span class="underline">order</span> in which your permission settings occur (bottom to top) is <span class="underline">crucial</span>! *
