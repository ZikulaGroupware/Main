### Hooks

**Please note: this information applies to PostCalendar v7.0.0+ only.**

PostCalendar provides create, update and delete hooks that can be utilized and
customized by any modules that wishes to create a calendar event along with
their own item creation. PostCalendar ships with an example of this
technology: _News_. You can find these examples as follows:

    modules/PostCalendar/lib/PostCalendar/PostCalendarEvent/News.php

each of these functions _could_ be located in their respective module's own
directory if the developer so chooses. Any additional functions that are
created by subsequent devs should be placed within their own module. Create
the following directory structure with your module:

    modules/<yourmodulename>/lib/<yourmodulename>/PostCalendarEvent/<yourmodulename>.php

within this file, create a class which extends the base class like so:

    class <yourmodulename>_PostCalendarEvent_<yourmodulename> extends PostCalendar_PostCalendarEvent_Base

within that class, you must create at least the following _required_ method:

    public function makeEvent($args)

Again, look in the PostCalendar module for examples.

Your makeEvent method must set the following properties that will form the event:

        $this->title
        $this->hometext
        $this->aid
        $this->time
        $this->informant
        $this->eventDate

There are additional class properties that can be set if you wish. Please see
the Base class for additional information.

    modules/PostCalendar/lib/PostCalendar/PostCalendarEvent/Base.php
