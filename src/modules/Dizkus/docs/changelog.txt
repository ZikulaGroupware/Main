2.7 (fs)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Note: Most of the bugs fixed in this list have been reported during the extensive
***       testphase before the release and do not necessarily fix bugs of the 2.6 version
***       because some new functionality introduced in 2.7 is affected.
+ Zikula 1.0 ready, Topics module from Zikula 1.0-SVN needs to be installed!
+ Using Ajax now for some features, this implied a major rewrite of some templates
  and adding a few new ones. Non-javascript fallbacks are included.
+ using resizable.js written by Kazuki Ohta (ohta@uei.co.jp)
+ animated gifs made Klaus Petzka (mail@petzi-juist.de)
+ optimized all functions that search forums (better performance)
+ Templates and layout reworked
+ The following plugins are declared obsolete and may not be present in
  future versions:
  addtopic_button
  favoriteforum_button
  listforummods
  mailtopic_button
  post_order_button
  splittopic_button
  subscribeforum_button
  subscribetopic_button
  Please use display logic to show the buttons, for more details see the
  recent templates.
+ added timezone support (credits go to Adrian Chapman for the idea). To use this in
  your templates, use the new pndate_format modifier instead of pndate_format, e.g.:
  <!--[ $lastpost.posted_unixtime|pndate_format:'datetimebrief':'':true ]-->
  The last parameter is activating the timezone support which adds the difference between
  the users timezone and the main timezone configured in your Zikula settings.
